### User Story

```md
AS a freelance web developer
I WANT to generate a simple logo for my projects

```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for text
THEN I can enter up to three characters
WHEN I am prompted for the text color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I am prompted for a shape
THEN I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square
WHEN I am prompted for the shape's color
THEN I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)
WHEN I have entered input for all the prompts
THEN an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`
AND the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line
